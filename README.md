# JARVISS
The 3 different models can be tested on the dataset RandomData.csv for accuracy. 
The necessary packages has to be installed.

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy xgboost tensorflow

The sensors are connected to the microcontroller unit through Inter-Integrated Circuits(I2C) interfacing. Sensing the physical and biological changes at fixed intervals, the data is acquired into the database for further processing. The generated data is processed and checked for deviations from the normal values by deploying the machine learning model to the device. The database generated by the sensor readings is made to run into the machine learning model for the prediction of whether the individual using the device is in danger or safe.
